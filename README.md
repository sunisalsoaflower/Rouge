# Rouge
Me and a friend collaboarated to make this game as our Object-orieneted programming project. Basically implements the classic rpg style game called rouge using principals of OOP. I'd like to thank all the pre-existing versions of 'Rouge' for inspiring us and helping us to make this projrct a reality.
